# 🎂 The Walshowetz Birthday Time Machine

## The Amazing Discovery That Started It All

Picture this: You're sitting around the dinner table and someone mentions, "Hey, didn't Jeremy's birthday fall on the same day of the week as Kate's this year?" And then you realize... wait... Waldo's birthday ALSO fell on the same weekday! And Gus too?!

🤯 **Mind = Blown**

That "what are the odds?" moment sparked this entire visualization. Because once you notice that pattern, you can't stop wondering: **How often do our family birthdays align on the same day of the week? Is this just a coincidence, or is there some beautiful mathematical pattern hiding in our family calendar?**

**Spoiler alert**: There IS a pattern, and it's absolutely mesmerizing to watch unfold over decades!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Model
Each birthday entry contains:
- `person`: Name (Jeremy, Kate, Waldo, Gus)
- `year`: YYYY
- `date`: Full ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `weekday`: Full day name (e.g., "Monday")
- `weekdayShort`: Abbreviated day (e.g., "Mon")
- `isLeapYear`: Boolean flag
- `color`: Hex color code for the person

### Technology Stack
- **D3.js v7**: For visualization, scales, axes, and interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, just modern JS
- **Static JSON**: Pre-computed data for fast loading

### The Walshowetz Family Timeline
- **Jeremy**: September 22, 1981 (Blue #3B82F6) - The dad who started this whole investigation
- **Kate**: October 20, 1984 (Red #EF4444) - The mom who first noticed the pattern  
- **Waldo**: June 23, 2019 (Green #10B981) - Kid #1 who joined the birthday dance
- **Gus**: April 27, 2021 (Yellow #F59E0B) - Kid #2 who completed the family constellation

## 🎆 The Mathematical Magic Explained

### Why This Happens (The Cool Math Part)

**The 7-Day Mystery**: Since there are 7 days in a week, and birthdays "advance" by one day each year (except leap years), there's a predictable pattern:
- In regular years: Your birthday moves forward 1 day of the week
- In leap years: Your birthday jumps forward 2 days of the week  
- After 28 years: The pattern repeats exactly!

### Family Alignment Years (The "OMG" Moments)

Some years, **multiple family birthdays fall on the same day of the week**. These magical alignments happen because:
1. Our birthdays are spread across different months
2. The mathematical "birthday walk" occasionally syncs up
3. Leap years create beautiful chaos that reshuffles everything

### What to Look For

🔍 **Hunt for Vertical Lines**: Years where dots line up vertically = same weekday for multiple birthdays!

🌀 **Follow the Red Lines**: Leap years (red vertical lines) are where the magic happens - they "reset" the pattern

🎢 **Zoom Out for Cycles**: The full 28-year cycle is mesmerizing to watch

🎉 **Weekend Birthday Years**: Find years where everyone gets weekend birthday parties!

## 🔄 Regenerating Data

If you need to modify the data (add people, change dates, etc.):

1. **Edit** `generate-data.js` with new information
2. **Run** the generator:
   ```bash
   node generate-data.js > data.json
   ```
3. **Refresh** your browser to see changes

## 🎉 Fun Family Discoveries

### Real Patterns We've Found:
- **2024**: Three family birthdays fell on weekends! 🎆
- **2027**: Jeremy and Kate's birthdays will both be on Wednesdays
- **2031**: Waldo gets his first "Friday the 23rd" birthday party
- **Around 2047**: The whole family enters a "weekend birthday era" that lasts several years!

### The Birthday Science:
- Each person's birthday "walks" forward one weekday per year (two during leap years)
- The complete cycle takes 28 years to reset
- Some family members get more "weekend birthdays" in certain decades
- The kids (Waldo & Gus) will experience completely different weekday patterns than the parents did

### Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It):
Find the years when the most family birthdays align on the same weekday. Hint: It happens more often than you'd think, and it's absolutely delightful when you spot the pattern!
