## The Amazing Discovery That Started It All

Picture this: Jeremy and Kate are heading out to an appointment, just casual conversation in the car, when Kate drops this completely random fun fact: "Oh hey, did you notice that all of our birthdays fell on the same day of the week this year?"

🤯 **Mind = Blown**

That casual observation stopped Jeremy in his tracks. Wait... ALL of them? Jeremy, Kate, Waldo, AND Gus? What are the actual odds of that happening? Is this just a wild coincidence, or is there some beautiful mathematical pattern hiding in our family calendar?

**Spoiler alert**: There IS a pattern, and it's absolutely mesmerizing to watch unfold over decades!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Model
Each birthday entry contains:
- `person`: Name (Jeremy, Kate, Waldo, Gus)
- `year`: YYYY
- `date`: Full ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `weekday`: Full day name (e.g., "Monday")
- `weekdayShort`: Abbreviated day (e.g., "Mon")
- `isLeapYear`: Boolean flag
- `color`: Hex color code for the person

### Technology Stack
- **D3.js v7**: For visualization, scales, axes, and interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling and layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, just modern JS
- **Static JSON**: Pre-computed data for fast loading

### The Walshowetz Family Timeline
- **Jeremy**: September 22, 1981 (Blue #3B82F6) - The dad who built this visualization after Kate's observation
- **Kate**: October 20, 1984 (Red #EF4444) - The mom who casually discovered the amazing pattern
- **Waldo**: June 23, 2019 (Green #10B981) - Kid #1 who joined the birthday dance
- **Gus**: April 27, 2021 (Yellow #F59E0B) - Kid #2 who completed the family constellation

## 🎆 The Mathematical Magic Explained

### Why This Happens (The Cool Math Part)

**The 7-Day Mystery**: Since there are 7 days in a week, and birthdays "advance" by one day each year (except leap years), there's a predictable pattern:
- In regular years: Your birthday moves forward 1 day of the week
- In leap years: Your birthday jumps forward 2 days of the week  
- After 28 years: The pattern repeats exactly!

### Family Alignment Years (The "OMG" Moments)

Some years, **multiple family birthdays fall on the same day of the week**. These magical alignments happen because:
1. Our birthdays are spread across different months
2. The mathematical "birthday walk" occasionally syncs up
3. Leap years create beautiful chaos that reshuffles everything

### What to Look For

🔍 **Hunt for Vertical Lines**: Years where dots line up vertically = same weekday for multiple birthdays!

🌀 **Follow the Red Lines**: Leap years (red vertical lines) are where the magic happens - they "reset" the pattern

🎢 **Zoom Out for Cycles**: The full 28-year cycle is mesmerizing to watch

🎉 **Weekend Birthday Years**: Find years where everyone gets weekend birthday parties!

## 🔄 Regenerating Data

If you need to modify the data (add people, change dates, etc.):

1. **Edit** `generate-data.js` with new information
2. **Run** the generator:
   ```bash
   node generate-data.js > data.json
   ```
3. **Refresh** your browser to see changes

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Notes

- ✅ Uses CDN links (no build step required)
- ✅ Static files only (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Works with custom domains
- ✅ HTTPS ready

## 🎉 Fun Family Discoveries

### Real Patterns We've Found:
- **2024**: Three family birthdays fell on weekends! 🎆
- **2027**: Jeremy and Kate's birthdays will both be on Wednesdays
- **2031**: Waldo gets his first "Friday the 23rd" birthday party
- **Around 2047**: The whole family enters a "weekend birthday era" that lasts several years!

### The Birthday Science:
- Each person's birthday "walks" forward one weekday per year (two during leap years)
- The complete cycle takes 28 years to reset
- Some family members get more "weekend birthdays" in certain decades
- The kids (Waldo & Gus) will experience completely different weekday patterns than the parents did

### Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It):
Find the years when the most family birthdays align on the same weekday. Hint: It happens more often than you'd think, and it's absolutely delightful when you spot the pattern!
