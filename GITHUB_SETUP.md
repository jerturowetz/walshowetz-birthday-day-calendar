# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 1. Create the GitHub Repository

Go to https://github.com/jerturowetz and click "New Repository":

- **Repository name**: `walshowetz-birthday-day-calendar`
- **Description**: `Interactive birthday day calendar showing weekday patterns for the Walshowetz family`
- **Visibility**: 
  - **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages) 
  - OR **Private** (requires paid GitHub plan for Pages)
- **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we already have files)

## 2. Connect and Push

After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/jerturowetz/walshowetz-birthday-day-calendar.git

# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
3. **Branch**: `main` (root directory)
4. **Save**

Your site will be available at:
`https://jerturowetz.github.io/walshowetz-birthday-day-calendar`

## 4. Privacy Settings

### Noindex Protection ✅
The site already includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` so search engines won't index it.

### Repository Privacy Options:

**Option A: Public Repo (Free)**
- ✅ GitHub Pages works for free
- ✅ Site is noindex (won't appear in search engines)
- ❌ Code is publicly visible on GitHub
- ℹ️ Most people won't find it unless they know the exact URL

**Option B: Private Repo (Paid Plan Required)**
- ✅ Code is completely private
- ✅ GitHub Pages works (requires GitHub Pro/Team/Enterprise)
- ✅ Site is noindex
- ℹ️ Best privacy but requires paid GitHub plan

## 5. Verification

After setup, verify:
- [ ] Repository exists at correct URL
- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled and building
- [ ] Site loads at GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] Visualization works correctly
- [ ] Meta noindex tags are present

## 6. Future Updates

To update the site:
```bash
# Make changes to files
# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update description"

# Push to GitHub (will auto-deploy)  
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy within a few minutes!
